  "readme": "# express-request-logger\n\nAn easy way to create a key/value pair list to be logged on each request in express.\n\n## Installation\n\n```` bash\n$ cd /path/to/your/project\n$ npm install express-request-logger\n````\n\n## Usage\n\nThis package is meant to be used as middleware for a web app using [Express](http://expressjs.com/). It will allow you to create a key/value pair list of data to get logged per request. Using this it can output data to allow you to analyze how your web app is being used.\n\n### Middleware Setup\n\nSince response time is a part of the logging output, express-request-logger should be put as early in the middleware chain as possible.\n\n```` javascript\nvar winston   = require('winston');\nvar reqLogger = require('express-request-logger');\n\nvar logger = new (winston.Logger)({ transports: [ new (winston.transports.Console)() ] });\napp.use(reqLogger.create(logger));\n````\n\n### Middleware Usage\n\nThe `req` object will now have a `kvLog` object that can have extra data added to it. At the end of the request it will be logged with all the other data collected.\n\n```` javascript\nfunction (req, res, next) {\n  // ...\n  req.kvLog.action = 'test';\n  // ...\n}\n````\n\nThe key ```message``` is special, it will be removed from the object and be sent to the logger as the true message. It is optional, so if it is not included, the log will just contain an empty message.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nCurrently it is recommended to use [winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston) as the logger object, but any object that can be called like `loggerObj.log(level, message, {key: value})` will work.\n",
